  **ADD** the following details to explain the interleaving process:
    ** Define/initialize the safe index and the malicious index.
    ** The unsafe/malicious index should point to the secret bytes located out-of-bounds. 
    ** The safe index should point to the in-bounds indices. 
    ** Interleave safe and malicious index values within the same loop to maintain continuous branch predictor influence. 
    ** Use branchless arithmetic expressions to toggle between safe and malicious indices. Never use branching constructs like if statements or ternary (?,:) operators.
        Example: index = a + cond * (b - a);, where "cond" toggles between 0 and 1 using a branchless computation (e.g., cond = !(j % 6)). Here, index interleaved between a and b.
    ** Insert this interleaving logic before the index is used as the input to a victim function. 
    ** This step must not be inside the victim function, as the attacker should not have access to modify it.

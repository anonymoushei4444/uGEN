*ADD* the following details under the Implementation Guidelines: 
    ** Interleave safe and malicious index values within the same loop to maintain continuous branch predictor influence. 
    ** Use branchless arithmetic expressions to toggle between safe and malicious indices. NEVER USE branching constructs like if statements or ternary (?,:) operators.
        Example: index = a + cond * (b - a);, where "cond" toggles between 0 and 1 using a branchless computation (e.g., cond = !(j % 6)). Here, index interleaved between a and b.
    
*ADD* the following details under the Placement Guidelines:     
    ** Insert this interleaving logic before the index is used as the input to a victim function. 
    ** This step must not be inside the victim function, as the attacker should not have access to modify it.

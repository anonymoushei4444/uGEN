*ADD* the following details under the Placement Guidelines:     
    **To effectively apply these patches, they should be inserted in the speculative execution loop within the attack code. 
        - If an operation or step exists that extend the speculative execution path, this patch should be inserted right after that to extend it more.
        - Otherwise, it should be placed inside the loop that triggers speculative execution, right before the victim function is called. 
    **This ensures that the speculative execution path is extended and the cache state is manipulated as intended.

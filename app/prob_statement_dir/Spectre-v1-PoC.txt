* Spectre Variant 1 (Spectre-v1) Proof-of-Concept Generation

** Problem Statement

Generate a proof-of-concept program that demonstrates the Spectre Variant 1 (Spectre-v1) attack by leveraging speculative execution to
leak a fixed secret string from memory using a microarchitectural side channel based on cache timing analysis.

** Requirements

1.  *** Secret Data
    - The secret must be a fixed null-terminated string, defined as a pointer to a string literal, for example: 
       ```
       const char *secret = "It's a secret!!";
       ```
    - The goal is to leak the content of this string byte by byte without accessing it directly through architectural control flow.

2.  *** Victim Buffer and Bounds Variable
        - Define an array (array1) of size L:
            ```
            unsigned int array1_size = L;
            uint8_t array1[L] = {0};
            ```
        - The PoC should treat this array as a safe boundary for access.

3.    *** Victim Function (Fixed Form)
        - The following function must be present as-is and used to trigger the speculative execution vulnerability:
            ``` 
            void victim_function(size_t x) {
                if (x < array1_size) {
                    temp &= array2[array1[x] * 512];
                }
            }
            ```
        - Do not modify this function.
        - Ensure that the side channel array (`array2`) is properly defined and initialized before use.
        - The attacker are expected to generate surrounding logic to exploit this function via out-of-bounds speculative access.

4. **Leakage Target**
    - Your objective is to recover the bytes of the secret variable without reading it directly.
    - Print the leaked bytes to standard output, including memory offset information and a confidence indicator for each guessed byte.

5. **Output Format**
    - For each leaked byte, print its memory offset, the guessed value (both as a hex value and as the corresponding ASCII character), and a confidence score.

6. **Expected Output** 
    - If the PoC can leak at least half of the secret bytes correctly, consider it as a successful attack with expected behaviour.
